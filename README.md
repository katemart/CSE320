# CSE320
various projects written in C

hw0 - simple assignment to get familiar with Git and Linux commands.

hw1 - command line utility to synthesize audio data containing Dual-Tone Multi-frequency (DTMF) signals and to detect DTMF signals in audio data. Implements a collection of functions with a focus on input/output, bitwise manipulation, and the use of pointers.

hw2 - debug and extend an already existing old program called "finddup" written by Bill Davidsen of GE Corporate R&D center. Focuses on the importance of maintaining and debugging existing C code, implementation of memory management and pointers, and use of gdb and valgrind as well as the C standard I/O library.

hw3 - create an allocator for the x86-64 architecture. Implements a collection of functions to simulate malloc, realloc, and free memory allocation functions in C. Focuses on the use of varying structures to simulate "singly-linked lists" and "doubly-linked lists", memory padding and alignment, and unit testing.

hw4 - create a program called "Legion", which manages a collection of "daemon" processes that implement various kinds of services in order to get familiar with low-level Unix/POSIX system calls. Implements use of process execution, signal handling, and I/O redirection.

hw5 - create a simple game server that allows users to play each other in a two-player game in order to become familiar with low-level POSIX threads, multi-threading safety, concurrency guarantees, and networking. Implements a collection of functions that use basic socket programming, thread execution, mutexes and semaphores, and concurrent data structures.
